PDF is rendered from a markdown source file. If you have special needs, you can change the markdown source file yourself for rendering. The reason why I chose markdown is because the amount of text is relatively large and typesetting is more convenient.
The source file complies with the MIT open source license, which roughly means you can play it however you like. I only left a signature at the end.
I wish you all good luck with your final semester.
